# NOTE: The create_district_heat_map function has been moved to dashboard_components.py
# and is used by the main dashboard (Format_Dash_Fixed.py) with processed data from data_processing.py
#
# This file is kept for reference but is not actively used by the main dashboard.
# The main dashboard uses:
# - heatmap.py -> create_heatmap_from_dataframe()
# - events_analysis.py -> create_service_events_heatmap() 
# - dashboard_components.py -> create_district_heat_map()
#
# All three functions receive processed data from the dashboard upload pipeline.
